									<li><span class="label">Name:</span> <span class="value">The title of the video game.</span></li>
									<li><span class="label">Platform:</span> <span class="value">The platform on which the game was released.</span></li>
									<li><span class="label">Year:</span> <span class="value">The release year of the game.</span></li>
									<li><span class="label">Genre:</span> <span class="value">The type or category of the game.</span></li>
									<li><span class="label">Publisher:</span> <span class="value">The company that published the game.</span></li>

								<p>Values were converted to appropriate formats: the Year column to date and the others to text. The dataset contained no duplicates but had blanks like "N/A" in the Year and Publisher columns. The median release year of 2007 was used to fill Year blanks. For Publisher blanks (1.57% of entries), those rows were removed.</p>

								<h4>Distribution and trend of video games sales</h4>
								<p style="margin-top: 2%">The analysis highlights a significant growth in global video game sales from the late 1980s until the mid-2000s, after which a steady decline has been observed, particularly since the end of 2008. <strong>North America</strong> remained the dominant market, accounting for nearly half of global sales, with <strong>Europe</strong> following at over a quarter. </p>

								<h4 style="margin-top: 1%">Most popular genre </h4>
								<p style="margin-top: 2%"> <strong>Action</strong> and <strong>Sports</strong> genre of video games were the most popular games. With over 3,281 games in Action genre and 2,317 games under Sports genre, these genres thwarted other genres when it came to the volume of games released across the years. When it comes to regional preferences, Action and Sports were also popular in every region, having similar sales percentages. Action games include Grand Theft Auto and Assassins’ Creed.

								<p>It is worth stating that <strong>Role-playing games</strong> such as Pokémon and Final Fantasy were popular in Japan compared to the rest of the world.
