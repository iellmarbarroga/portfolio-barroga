								<h3>Data Overview</h3>
								<p>The data for this analysis was sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The dataset contains information about global video game sales from 1980s to 2010s, with each row representing a specific video game. Key columns include:</p>

								<h3 style="margin-top: 3%;">Data preprocessing</h3>
								<p>The format of the values was converted to an appropriate format depending on the column. For the Sales column, it was not stated if it was in terms of currency, so I assumed it to be the units or the number of games sold. The Year column was converted to Number. Others were already in the general format, so no changes were made.
									The dataset has no duplicate values, but it was found that it contained blanks such as “N/A” and “unknown” in the Year and Publisher column.

								<p style="margin-top: 3%;">The median game release Year was calculated using the Excel formula <strong>=MEDIAN(Sales[Year])</strong> which is 2007. It was used to fill null values in the Year column.</p>

								</p>

								<p style="margin-top: 3%;">For the remaining blanks in the Publisher column, I decided to remove these entries from the dataset as it was only 1.57% of the total entries (261 out of 16,598 entries).</p>

								<h3 style="margin-top: 2%;">Analysis and Findings</h3>
								
								<h4>Distribution and trend of video games sales</h4>
								<p style="margin-top: 2%">The analysis highlights a significant growth in global video game sales in millions from the late 1990s until the mid-2000s, after which a steady decline has been observed, particularly since the end of 2008. </p>

								<h4 style="margin-top: 1%">Most popular genre </h4>
								<p style="margin-top: 2%"> <strong>Action</strong> and <strong>Sports</strong> genre of video games were the most popular games. With over 3,281 games in Action genre and 2,317 games under Sports genre, these genres thwarted other genres when it came to the volume of games released across the years.

								<p style="margin-top: 1%">It is worth stating that <strong>Role-playing games</strong> such as Pokémon and Final Fantasy were popular in Japan compared to the rest of the world. Almost 30% of Japan video games sales were games under <strong>Role-Playing</strong> genre. This is massively overwhelming compared to other regions which is typically around only 8-9%. </p>

								<h4 style="margin-top: 2%">Most popular game company</h4>
								<p style="margin-top: 2%"><strong>Nintendo</strong> tops other companies at 1,786.56 million units sold globally.

								<p style="margin-top: 2%">It is also important to show that <strong>Nintendo</strong> has consistently been the dominant force in the video game industry, with significant spikes in sales, particularly between 2006 and 2009. During this time, Nintendo reached its highest peak in terms of units sold, outpacing its competitors by a large margin. Although <strong>Electronic Arts</strong> and <strong>Activision</strong> also had notable periods of growth, their overall sales figures remained much lower than Nintendo's.</p>

								<h3 style="margin-top: 4%">Insights</h3>
								<p style="margin-top: 2%">To maximize sales in <strong>North American</strong> and <strong>European</strong> markets, focusing marketing and distribution efforts in these regions is essential due to their substantial market share. Prioritizing <strong>Action</strong> and <strong>Sports</strong> games, which were particularly popular in these areas, can significantly enhance sales potential and audience engagement. By targeting these genres, publishers can tap into established preferences and increase their chances of commercial success. </p>
								<p>Additionally, adapting to regional genre preferences is key for broader success. In <strong>Japan</strong>, there is a strong demand for <strong>Role-Playing games (RPGs)</strong>, making it important to increase the development and promotion of RPGs in this market. Globally, <strong>Action</strong> and <strong>Sports</strong> games remain widely appealing across multiple regions, making these genres ideal for a cohesive global marketing strategy.</p>
								<p>The data on global video game sales reveals Nintendo's tremendous success over the years which can offer valuable insights that could be studied or even replicated by competitors. By examining their unique value proposition—such as its focus on innovative, family-friendly gaming experiences and its ability to consistently engage a broad audience—other companies might uncover strategies that could be applied to their own markets. Additionally, identifying areas where Nintendo may not be as strong could present opportunities to innovate in spaces outside of Nintendo's primary focus, giving competitors a chance to carve out their own unique advantages in the gaming industry.</p>
								
								<h3 style="margin-top: 3%;">Conclusion</h3>
								<p>This analysis of global video game sales provides valuable insights into industry trends. Understanding sales dynamics, regional preferences, and publisher performance is crucial for stakeholders navigating this dynamic landscape. Ongoing analysis will remain essential as the video game market evolves.</p>
